# House Price Prediction API
 A Machine Learning API for predicting California housing prices, inspired by Chapter 2 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron. This project walks through the full pipeline—from data preprocessing to prediction—exposed as a simple RESTful API using **FastAPI**.
