A Machine Learning API for predicting California housing prices, inspired by Chapter 2 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron. This project walks through the full pipeline, from data preprocessing to prediction, exposed as a simple API using **FastAPI**.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This API provides housing price predictions based on longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity. It encapsulates all the steps from the book’s chapter including:
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Custom feature engineering
- Model training using `RandomForestRegressor`
- Pipeline serialization using `joblib`
- And finally, exposing predictions via an API

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **ML Library:** Scikit-learn
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Serialization:** Joblib

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aliiakbarkhan/house-price-prediction-api.git
cd house-price-prediction-api

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the API
uvicorn main:app --reload
```


## How to Use the API


Once running, the API will be available at:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

## Post / Predict
Send a JSON payload like:
```bash
{
  "longitude": -122.23,
  "latitude": 37.88,
  "housing_median_age": 41.0,
  "total_rooms": 880.0,
  "total_bedrooms": 129.0,
  "population": 322.0,
  "households": 126.0,
  "median_income": 8.3252,
  "ocean_proximity": "NEAR BAY"
}


```
## Response
```bash
{
  "prediction": 452100.0 (which is $4,52,100)
}
```
